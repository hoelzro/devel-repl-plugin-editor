=head1 NAME

Devel::REPL::Plugin::Editor - Add #edit command to drop into an editor for longer expressions

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # in ~/.re.pl/repl.rc
  $_REPL->load_plugin('Editor');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin adds an C<edit> command to your REPL, invoked using C<#edit> (or
using whatever L<Devel::REPL::Plugin::Turtles/default_command_prefix> is).
When you run the the edit command, the REPL drops you into C<$ENV{'EDITOR'}>,
and the code you type in that file is executed after you exit the editor.
